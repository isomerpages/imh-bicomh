<p>On behalf of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), I am delighted to invite
you to the inaugural Biennial International Congress on Mental Health (BICOMH)
2024.</p>
<p>This four-day hybrid event, scheduled for November 2024, represents a
pivotal moment for global mental health awareness and support. Mental health
is a pressing issue; the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
one in four people will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime,
underscoring the critical need for effective support systems.</p>
<p>BICOMH will feature two conferences: the 8th Asian Congress of Schizophrenia
Research (ACSR) on November 19-20, and the International Society of Addiction
Medicine (ISAM) Regional Conference on November 21-22. ACSR will focus
on optimizing recovery for individuals living with schizophrenia, while
ISAM will explore community support for behavioral addiction recovery.</p>
<p>Our focus areas, schizophrenia and behavioral addictions, are significant.
Schizophrenia is a severe mental health disorder affecting approximately
24 million people globally, or 1 in 300 people, according to WHO (2022).
The rise of behavioral addictions, such as internet gaming and gambling,
is also a growing concern. These disorders not only impact individuals
and their support networks but also contribute to social and economic costs,
including productivity loss, increased healthcare utilization, stigma,
and discrimination.</p>
<p>BICOMH’s core theme, “Building Bridges for an Effective Mental Health
Ecosystem,” reflects a global effort to enhance treatment approaches and
strengthen the mental health ecosystem through collaboration and knowledge
exchange among clinicians, communities, and clients.</p>
<p>The Congress will bring together a diverse lineup of speakers, both local
and international, whose expertise and varied perspectives aim to drive
progress in the management of schizophrenia and behavioral addictions.
Through the sharing of research findings and best practices, we strive
to improve treatment outcomes and empower communities to provide more effective
support systems for individuals on their recovery journey.</p>
<p>Whether you are a clinician, service provider, or client, BICOMH offers
a unique opportunity to learn, forge valuable connections, and contribute
to shaping a brighter future for mental health worldwide.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming you to BICOMH 2024.</p>
<p><strong><em>A/Prof Daniel Fung</em></strong>
<br>Chairman, 2024 BICOMH Advisory Committee, and
<br>Chief Executive Officer, Institute of Mental Health</p>
