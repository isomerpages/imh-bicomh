<p>&nbsp;<strong>Abstract Evaluation Criteria</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;To assist authors in preparing high-quality submissions, abstracts
will be evaluated according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Relevance and Significance</strong>
</p>
<p>The research topic must demonstrate clear relevance to the conference
theme "Scientific Frontiers in Mood &amp; Anxiety Disorders: Multimorbidity,
Digital Innovation, and Therapeutic Transformation" and hold substantial
importance for conference attendees and the broader scientific community
working in mood and anxiety disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Research Focus and Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>Aims and research questions should be clearly articulated, appropriately
focused, and directly relevant to the chosen conference track. Objectives
must be sufficiently specific and achievable within the scope of the presented
work, avoiding overly broad or unfocused research questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Methodological Rigour</strong>
</p>
<p>The methodology must be appropriate for addressing the stated research
objectives, scientifically sound, and clearly justified. Authors should
provide sufficient detail regarding their approach, including analytical
methods, to allow proper evaluation of the research design's validity and
reliability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Results and Data Interpretation</strong>
</p>
<p>Findings must align with the stated aims, be presented accurately, and
demonstrate valid interpretation of the data. Results should be clearly
communicated with appropriate statistical analysis where applicable, ensuring
conclusions are supported by the evidence presented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scientific Conclusions</strong>
</p>
<p>Conclusions must logically follow from the presented results and directly
address the original research objectives. Authors should avoid overstating
findings or drawing conclusions that extend beyond what the data supports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Quality</strong>
</p>
<p>Abstracts must demonstrate scientific rigour through clear, grammatically
correct writing that effectively communicates complex ideas. The structure
should facilitate understanding whilst maintaining appropriate academic
standards throughout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovation and Impact</strong>
</p>
<p>Evaluation considers the novelty of the research approach, innovative
methodologies, generation of new insights, and potential impact on clinical
practice, policy development, or advancement of scientific knowledge within
mood and anxiety disorder research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appropriateness for Academic Presentation</strong>
</p>
<p>The research topic and findings must be suitable for presentation at an
academic conference, free from content that could raise ethical concerns,
political sensitivities, or potential harm to participants or the broader
community. Work involving sensitive populations or controversial topics
must demonstrate appropriate ethical oversight and responsible presentation
of findings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Scientific Programme Committee reserves the
right to request additional information or clarification regarding any
aspect of submitted abstracts during the review process.</p>
