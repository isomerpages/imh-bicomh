<h2><strong>Asian Congress of Schizophrenia Research 2024</strong></h2>
<p>Welcome to the 8th Asian Congress of Schizophrenia Research (ACSR) 2024,
to be held in Singapore on 19 &amp; 20 November 2024.</p>
<p>Organised by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), in collaboration with
the Asian College of Schizophrenia Research and supported by the College
of Psychiatrists and Singapore Psychiatric Association, this conference
will gather professionals in the field to discuss and exchange insights
along the theme "Strategies for Optimising Psychosis Recovery in Asia."</p>
<p>ACSR is part of the inaugural Biennial International Congress on Mental
Health (BICOMH), which features another conference co-organised with the
