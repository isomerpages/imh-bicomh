<h4><strong>Title: </strong>The Synergistic Effect of D2 and 5-HT7 Antagonism in Managing Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Depression Patients for Functional Recovery</h4>
<h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>
<p>This presentation explores the therapeutic potential of LATUDA (Lurasidone),
a multireceptor targeting antipsychotic, in managing schizophrenia and
Bipolar I depression, emphasizing functional recovery. The discussion begins
with an analysis of Lurasidone’s receptor profile, highlighting its balanced
antagonistic action on D2 and 5-HT7 receptors, alongside its partial agonism
at 5-HT1A receptors. These unique receptor interactions are shown to contribute
to both efficacy and tolerability, providing an improved treatment landscape
for patients.</p>
<p>The presentation will elucidate how D2 antagonism, in concert with 5-HT7
antagonism and 5-HT1A agonism, enables Lurasidone to enhance therapeutic
outcomes, addressing the positive, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits
prevalent in both schizophrenia and Bipolar I depression. The role of these
mechanisms in supporting functional and cognitive improvements, crucial
for patient quality of life and societal integration, will be examined.</p>
<p>Finally, data on optimal dosing will be reviewed, with clinical insights
for tailoring treatment regimens that maximize therapeutic benefit while
minimizing side effects. Through these discussions, the speaker will provide
a comprehensive overview of Lurasidone’s positioning as an effective and
tolerable option for long-term management and functional recovery in schizophrenia
and Bipolar I depression.</p>
