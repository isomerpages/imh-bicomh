<p>His primary research focus is on behavioural addictions, which encompasses
a wide range of conditions, including internet gaming disorder, social
media addiction, and problematic pornography use. He examines the conceptualisation,
measurements, correlates, effects, and interventions related to these conditions
to enhance our understanding and delineate their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>Additionally, he employs sophisticated techniques such as meta-analysis
to summarise effect sizes and address inconsistencies in the literature.
His research has notably provided a pooled prevalence rate of internet
gaming disorder in Southeast Asia and clarified the complex relationships
between this disorder and personality traits.</p>
