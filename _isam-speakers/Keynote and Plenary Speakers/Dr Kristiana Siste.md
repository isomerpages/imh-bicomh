<p>Dr Kristiana Siste's dedicated efforts have made significant contributions
to scientific knowledge, national and global policies, and the field of
epidemiology concerning addictive behaviours. She has collaborated extensively
with experts from esteemed institutions including Kyoto University, Flinders
University (Statewide Gambling Therapy Services), The University of Queensland,
Radboud University in the Netherlands, Japan National Center of Neurology
and Psychiatry, and other prominent centres focused on behavioural addictions.</p>
<p>Her notable collaboration with Kyoto University led to the development
of the Internet Addiction Diagnostic Questionnaire (KDAI), a culturally
adaptable screening tool specifically designed for Indonesian adolescents.
Her research has further investigated the neurofunctional correlates underpinning
a triple-network model, now integrated into national protocols for the
prevention and screening of addictive behaviours in primary care and educational
settings.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr Siste conducted a nationwide study in
partnership with Indonesia's Ministry of Research and Innovation, and Ministry
of State-Owned Enterprises, generating the first comprehensive epidemiological
data on behavioural addiction in Indonesia using the KDAI.</p>
<p>Dr Siste's contributions extend internationally through her participation
in the World Health Organisation (WHO) Advisory Group for Behavioural Addiction's
Delphi study, where she helped in shaping foundational concepts in global
addictive behaviour research. These insights have been instrumental in
developing management frameworks that incorporate the dialectical model.
Her persistent endeavours have resulted in collaborative researches in
behavioural addiction field, published in internationally renowned journals
and implemented into comprehensive services.</p>
<p>At Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital - Faculty of Medicine, Universitas
Indonesia, Dr Siste established and oversees the National Behavioural Addiction
Study Center and National Behavioural Addiction Treatment Center. She also
serves as a senior lecturer, Head of the Addiction Psychiatry Division,
and Head of the Psychiatric Department, mentoring emerging physicians and
researchers. Internationally, she holds positions on the Advisory Board
of The WPA Addiction Psychiatry Section and is a member of the International
Working Group for Behavioural Addiction.</p>
