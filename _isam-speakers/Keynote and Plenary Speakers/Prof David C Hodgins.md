<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Plenary Title: Advances in Reducing Gambling Disorder</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Commercial gambling is continuing to grow in many jurisdictions around
the world. The prevalence of gambling disorder ranges from 0.1% to 5.7%
of adults, and many more experience gambling-related harms to themselves
or their families. Although rates of treatment-seeking for gambling disorder
are low, recent research shows that many individuals are making active
self-directed attempts to reduce gambling. The pathways and strategies
people are trying in their change attempts and their success will be presented
and discussed. This presentation will also describe an international initiative
to develop evidence-based lower risk gambling guidelines that people can
use to gauge their level of gambling involvement (how often, how much,
how many types?). Public health approaches have focused mainly on educating
consumers about the harms and providing general advice for people to gamble
responsibly. These lower risk guidelines aim to provide more specific advice
about the risk of harm. The guidelines are also useful for clinicians to
help individuals to set personal limits and for industry to direct consumers
to pre-commit to relatively safe personal time and expenditure limits.</p>
