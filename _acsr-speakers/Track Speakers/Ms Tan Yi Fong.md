<p>Ms Tan is involved in the advocacy, training, research, and implementation
of the department’s co-production efforts. She works closely with her clinician
colleagues and volunteers consisting of persons-in-recovery, caregivers,
and members of the public to plan, design, develop and deliver psycho-education
workshops such as the Broken Crayons Still Colour series.</p>
<p>This work is close to her heart as she was a beneficiary of EPIP’s services.
Prior to this, she received mentorship as a peer support apprentice and
helped co-plan and co-facilitate psycho-social interventions she used to
benefit from.</p>
