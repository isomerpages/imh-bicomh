<p>Ms Loh is a Year 4 medical student at the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine,
Nanyang Technological University. Her interest in digital mental health
was sparked via her internship with the Data, Science, and Technology department
of the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), where she worked
closely with the Project HOPES team to understand and evaluate psychosis-focused
mobile health interventions. This motivated her to pursue further research
in the subject matter via a rigorous systematic mapping review, which has
been accepted for publication with the Journal of Medical Internet Research.
Ms Loh's work has been recognized as a NTU President Research Scholar with
the mentorship of psychiatrist-scientist A/Prof Jimmy Lee; she was also
invited to share her insights as a guest speaker at the MOHT Learning Sessions.</p>
