<p>Ms Teo Jia Yan works with adults with varying degree of mental health
conditions and is passionate in supporting persons in their recovery journey.
She uses a systemic approach to work with persons with mental health conditions
and their families in developing care plans to support their wellbeing
as they transit to the community.</p>
<p>Currently, she is the lead MSW in the IMH Stepping Stones, which is an
Inpatient Psychiatric Rehabilitation Centre. She also provides therapeutic
group interventions to support persons in recovery to regain and retain
hope. Additionally, Ms Teo works closely with the Peer Support Specialists
(PSS) in her team to co-create programmes in Stepping Stones. This collaborative
work between the MSWs and PSS further enhances the recovery journey of
persons with mental health conditions as they tap on the lived experiences
of the PSS. Ms Teo engages in interagency work where she outreaches to
community partners through actively organising networking sessions. Furthermore,
she provides trainings sessions for community partners with the aim of
increasing community mental health literacy and social health integration,
to benefit persons with mental health conditions. Ms Teo is caring for
a Bichonpoo puppy named Bonito and enjoys travelling to other countries.</p>
