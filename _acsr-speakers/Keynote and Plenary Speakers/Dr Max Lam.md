<p>Dr Max Lam is a young investigator in neuropsychiatric genomics whose
work spans various significant roles, including the Principal Investigator
at the CONCISE Mental Health StudyBeyond these roles, Dr Lam extends his
expertise as a Visiting Scientist at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric
Research, The Broad Institute ofMIT and Harvard, and the Division of Psychiatry
Research, Zucker Hillside Hospital in New York, USA.</p>
<p>Dr Lam has significantly contributed to cognitive and psychiatric genetics
throughout his career. His work has elucidated the genetic architecture
of cognitive function, identified genomic loci associated with cognitive
ability, and identified actionable variants for nootropic drug targets.
His research into psychiatric genetics has extended biological insights
into schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses across diverse ancestries,
highlighting the need for large-scale genomic studies worldwide.</p>
<p>Dr Lamâ€™s work has been pivotal in understanding cognitive and clinical
predictors of psychopathology. His early career focused on large-scale
research efforts investigating schizophrenia and psychosis risk in Singapore,
producing one of the first normative cognitive datasets in an Asian cohort.
This work has led to identifying specific predictors of functional outcomes
in young individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis, contributing significantly
to the understanding of cognitive impairments across psychiatric illnesses.</p>
<p>With a h-index of 27 and over 9,511 citations as of August 2024, Dr Lam's
academic publications showcase his role as a leading scientist in neuropsychiatric
genomics. His leadership in the field is further exemplified by his role
as mPI of the NIH-funded Cognitive Genomics Consortium, The PRECISE-SG100K
Cognitive Flagship Programme, and his numerous first and last-authored
manuscripts, which have provided substantial insights into the genetics
of cognitive performance and psychiatric disorders. Dr Max Lam's contributions
to science advance our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric
conditions and cognitive functions. His work aims to pave the way for future
research directions and therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatry.</p>
