<p>Dr Raymond Chan has a long-standing interest in schizophrenia and related
disorders, and mentally at-risk individuals. His research interests include
(1) identification of biomarkers or endophenotypes for schizophrenia and
related disorders; (2) developmental and experimental psychopathology of
schizophrenia and related disorders, especially for anhedonia; and (3)
distinct and shared psychopathologies across clinical groups and their
subclinical sample using a wide range of neuroscientific methods including
structural and functional (resting-state and task-based) MRI and MRS as
well as behavioural genetics.</p>
<p>He has received various research awards and honours including the Elected
member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts (Medicine), Fellow
for the Association for Psychological Science, SIRS Global Schizophrenia
Award, International Neuropsychological Society Arthur-Benton Mid-Career
Award, the Distinguished Young Scientist Award from the National Natural
Science Foundation China, and Young Investigator Award from the NARSAD.</p>
<p>He holds numerous competitive research grants from various funding agencies
including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation
China, and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China. Dr Chan has
published over 500 scientific peer-reviewed articles and 6 book chapters
in the areas of schizophrenia, major depressive disorders and traumatic
brain injury. He is currently serving as the editor-in-chief for PsyCh
Journal, and on the editorial boards for Schizophrenia Research, Schizophrenia

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Plenary Title: Negative Symptoms Assessment for Schizophrenia: Theoretical Models and Clinical Implications</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder characterised by psychotic
symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. Negative symptoms
in schizophrenia constitute a heterogeneous syndrome that comprises anhedonia,
avolition, asociality, alogia and blunted affect. Recently, there is reviving
interest in studying negative symptoms as these symptoms are less responsive
to conventional and atypical antipsychotic medications.</p>
<p>With the guidance of the advanced theoretical framework of anhedonia,
I will first address the issue of anhedonia paradox observed in schizophrenia
and the recent reconceptualisation of negative symptoms in schizophrenia
research. I will adopt the two-factor model of negative symptoms, i.e.,
the Motivation and Pleasure (MAP) factor and the Expression (EXP) factor,
and further illustrate with a series of studies to highlight the important
role of MAP factor but not EXP factor contributing to social functioning
in these patients. These findings help to validate and establish a set
of measures to characterise the evaluation of anhedonia and highlight potential
development of intervention platform for anhedonia across clinical and
subclinical populations.</p>
