<p>Prof Jones’ research interests have centred on the clinical epidemiology
of psychotic disorders including early developmental antecedents, causes
and mechanisms; randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of novel and established
interventions for mental disorders and of service designs to deliver these
treatments; and the implications of permeable diagnostic boundaries across
medicine and psychiatry.</p>
<p>Current RCTs include the SINAPPS-2 study of immune therapies in antibody-positive
psychosis, Wellcome’s PUMA platform trial (both with Lennox and others),
and the TYPPEX programme investigating treatments for common mental disorders
including psychotic experiences (with Perez).</p>
<p>Clinically, Prof Jones has been involved in the management of all stages
of psychotic disorders and was a co-founder of Cambridgeshire’s award-winning
CAMEO early intervention in psychosis service. His management positions
have included Chairmanship of the Department of Psychiatry and Deputy Head
of the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of Cambridge; he is
a past-president of the International Early Intervention and Prevention
in Mental Health Association (IEPA), and co-founder of Cambridge Adaptive
Testing Ltd.</p>
<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Keynote Address: Psychotic Experiences, Early Intervention and Some Thoughts Against the Stream</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>This keynote lecture covers the background and early results of ‘TYPPEX’,
a 10-year research programme into the meaning and treatment implications
of psychotic experiences (PEs) in people attending primary care services
for common mental disorders (CMD). In the context of early intervention,
PEs are seen as indicators of a mental state that already is, or may evolve
into a first episode psychosis (FEP) syndrome, or as residual features
of such a condition following treatment or natural resolution. Outside
these specialist services most people with PEs never progress to that full
syndrome. PEs can be viewed as a test for psychotic disorder: while most
people with a psychotic disorder have a positive test, Bayes’ theorem reminds
that is not the same as indicating how likely someone who has PEs will
develop a psychotic disorder. This depends on the prior probability of
FEP: high in a specialist EI service but very low in the general population
or primary care where depression and anxiety are common. But common mental
disorders including PEs (CMD-PE) are not included in standard diagnostic
criteria, and services for common mental disorders rarely consider, let
alone measure PE. This lecture expands the theoretical justification of
searching for CMD-PE in high-volume primary care services for more severe
depression and anxiety, reports a prevalence study confirming these predictions,
and describes clinical phenomenology and outcomes of CMD-PE. Network analysis
of phenomenology informed the clinical reformulation of PE and the development
of a new CBT-based approach (CBT-ts); this is in the late stages of a multi-centre,
stepped-wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial of PE measurement and
therapist training. The disruptive implications of this reappraisal of
PE as informative in common illnesses will be discussed; they are a new
bridge in the mental health ecosystem, not confined to specialist practice.</p>
