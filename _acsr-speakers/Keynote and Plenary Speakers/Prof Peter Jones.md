<p>Prof Jones’ research interests have centred on the clinical epidemiology
of psychotic disorders including early developmental antecedents, causes
and mechanisms; randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of novel and established
interventions for mental disorders and of service designs to deliver these
treatments; and the implications of permeable diagnostic boundaries across
medicine and psychiatry.</p>
<p>Current RCTs include the SINAPPS-2 study of immune therapies in antibody-positive
psychosis, Wellcome’s PUMA platform trial (both with Lennox and others),
and the TYPPEX programme investigating treatments for common mental disorders
including psychotic experiences (with Perez).</p>
<p>Clinically, Prof Jones has been involved in the management of all stages
of psychotic disorders and was a co-founder of Cambridgeshire’s award-winning
CAMEO early intervention in psychosis service. His management positions
have included Chairmanship of the Department of Psychiatry and Deputy Head
of the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of Cambridge; he is
a past-president of the International Early Intervention and Prevention
in Mental Health Association (IEPA), and co-founder of Cambridge Adaptive
Testing Ltd.</p>
