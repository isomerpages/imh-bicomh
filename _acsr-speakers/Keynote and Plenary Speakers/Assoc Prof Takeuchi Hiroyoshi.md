<p>After graduating from Chiba University School of Medicine in 2001, Dr
Takeuchi joined Keio University School of Medicine as a clinician-researcher.</p>
<p>After completing his PhD programme at Keio University School of Medicine
in 2012, Dr Takeuchi worked as a postdoctoral/clinical fellow at Centre
for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto until 2017. His primary research
interest is optimising antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia across
the illness stage (i.e., first-episode to treatment-resistant schizophrenia)
and the treatment phase (i.e., acute to maintenance treatment) to improve
cognitive impairment and negative symptoms, core but treatment resistant
features in schizophrenia, while minimising side effects.</p>
<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Plenary Title: Optimising Antipsychotic Treatment in Acute and Maintenance Phases of Schizophrenia</h4>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Date: </strong>19 November 2024, Tuesday
<br><strong>Time: </strong>11.30 AM</p>
<p>Antipsychotics play a crucial role not only in improving symptoms during
the acute phase but also in preventing relapse during the maintenance phase
of schizophrenia. However, treatment continuity faces challenges, such
as poor medication adherence, often due to limited illness insight and
the adverse effects of antipsychotics. In this context, optimising antipsychotic
treatment throughout both the acute and maintenance phases of schizophrenia
is essential, aiming to maximise efficacy while minimising side effects.
Strategies for optimisation include dose adjustments (increasing or decreasing
doses), once-daily dosing regimens, and the use of long-acting injectable
formulations. In this presentation, I will discuss each of these strategies,
supported by recent evidence, including findings from our own studies.</p>
