<p>After graduating from Chiba University School of Medicine in 2001, Dr
Takeuchi joined Keio University School of Medicine as a clinician-researcher.</p>
<p>After completing his PhD programme at Keio University School of Medicine
in 2012, Dr Takeuchi worked as a postdoctoral/clinical fellow at Centre
for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto until 2017. His primary research
interest is optimising antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia across
the illness stage (i.e., first-episode to treatment-resistant schizophrenia)
and the treatment phase (i.e., acute to maintenance treatment) to improve
cognitive impairment and negative symptoms, core but treatment resistant
features in schizophrenia, while minimising side effects.</p>
