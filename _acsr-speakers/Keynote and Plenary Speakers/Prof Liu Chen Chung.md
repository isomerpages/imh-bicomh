<p>From 2006 to 2010, Dr Liu Chen-Chung worked with Professor Hwu Hai-Gwo
in a prospective follow-up study of the psychopathological progress of
early schizophrenia-like disorder (SOPRES). He has published a series of
papers regarding early detection, screening tool, transitioning from ultra-high
risk (UHR) to psychosis, pharmacotherapy for prodromal psychosis, changes
in neurocognitive functioning at early stage of psychosis, and even longer-term
follow-up of initial non-converters as well as the 10-year outcomes of
first episode psychosis of this cohort.</p>
<p>Since 2017, his clinical research mainly focused on a guided antipsychotic
reduction to reach the minimum effective dose (GARMED) trial for patients
who have remitted from psychosis and wished to reduce and even discontinue
antipsychotics. He proposed his rationale of creating a compromised solution
for optimising risk-to-benefit ratio of antipsychotic treatment in remitted
psychosis, developed a dose reduction algorithm and a study protocol to
be tested on this population in real world practice. The results of GARMED
trial are encouraging, published in a series of papers on this topic and
he gave talks about this topic on 2023 IEPA and 2024 SIRS conferences.</p>
<p>He has been a visiting scholar/clinical observer at the Orygen Youth Health
Center, Melbourne, Australia in 2012. He received 3 Dr Paul Janssen Schizophrenia
Research Paper Awards presented by the Taiwanese Society of Psychiatry
in 2011, 2014, 2016. He is the former president of the Taiwanese Society
of Schizophrenia Research (TSSR) from 2019 to 2023, and is currently an
executive board member of ACSR (Asian College of Schizophrenia Research),
as well as a member of TAPER (Tapering AntiPsychotics and Evaluating Recovery)
International Research Consortium.</p>
<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Plenary Title: Maintenance of Patients with Remitted Psychosis: Is it Possible to Reduce or Discontinue Antipsychotics?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Patients in a remitted state of schizophrenia face a dilemma: should they
improve their quality of life by reducing antipsychotics or should they
maintain on stable dose to prevent a relapse. Clinical guidelines suggest
a chance to stop antipsychotics after remitted from first episode psychosis
for a period of time, but provide no guidance regarding how to discontinue
medications safely. We tested in real world practice if an operationalised
exponential guided-dose-reduction algorithm can help patients reach a lower
effective dose, not at the expense of increased risks of relapse (the GARMED
trial). We also depicted and examined dose-tapering trajectories as to
explore factors associated with different tapering patterns and provide
insights for re-evaluating the risk-to-benefit balance.</p>
<p>We found that guided dose reduction seems to be an approach applicable
to patients who were cooperative and conscious during dose reduction. The
relapse rates of dose reduction group and maintenance group were less than
20% in 2 years. A substantial proportion of patients could successfully
reduce up to 60% of their baseline doses and experience better functioning
and quality of life by the end of 2 years. Moreover, we collected blood
samples under different daily doses to verify if patientâ€™s stable condition
could be maintained not only under an antipsychotic dose much lower than
the generally recommended level (chlorpromazine equivalent (CPZE) 200 mg/d),
but also a minimal plasma drug concentration of aripiprazole (120 ng/mL)
in a subset of this cohort.</p>
<p>However, even though the relapse risk of our dose-reduction group is comparable
to their maintenance counterparts, a quarter of patients in the dose-reduction
group failed to decrease any dose by the end of 2 years. This fact should
be taken into account when considering whether tapering antipsychotics
should be attempted. A balanced view regarding the pros and cons and a
shared decision-making process is pivotal. Moreover, a guided dose reduction
comprises dynamic processes with differences between individual trajectories.
Longer term observations, more flexible tapering processes, and a closer
monitoring of factors related to successful or failed tapering, are anticipated
to improve outcomes of dose-reduction trials. The lessons to be learned
from GARMED trial are not about how low the absolute dosage you can attain,
but how to reach a relatively lower dosage safely.</p>
