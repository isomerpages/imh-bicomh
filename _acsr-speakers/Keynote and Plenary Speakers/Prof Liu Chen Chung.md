<p>From 2006 to 2010, Dr Liu Chen-Chung worked with Professor Hwu Hai-Gwo
in a prospective follow-up study of the psychopathological progress of
early schizophrenia-like disorder (SOPRES). He has published a series of
papers regarding early detection, screening tool, transitioning from ultra-high
risk (UHR) to psychosis, pharmacotherapy for prodromal psychosis, changes
in neurocognitive functioning at early stage of psychosis, and even longer-term
follow-up of initial non-converters as well as the 10-year outcomes of
first episode psychosis of this cohort.</p>
<p>Since 2017, his clinical research mainly focused on a guided antipsychotic
reduction to reach the minimum effective dose (GARMED) trial for patients
who have remitted from psychosis and wished to reduce and even discontinue
antipsychotics. He proposed his rationale of creating a compromised solution
for optimising risk-to-benefit ratio of antipsychotic treatment in remitted
psychosis, developed a dose reduction algorithm and a study protocol to
be tested on this population in real world practice. The results of GARMED
trial are encouraging, published in a series of papers on this topic and
he gave talks about this topic on 2023 IEPA and 2024 SIRS conferences.</p>
<p>He has been a visiting scholar/clinical observer at the Orygen Youth Health
Center, Melbourne, Australia in 2012. He received 3 Dr Paul Janssen Schizophrenia
Research Paper Awards presented by the Taiwanese Society of Psychiatry
in 2011, 2014, 2016. He is the former president of the Taiwanese Society
of Schizophrenia Research (TSSR) from 2019 to 2023, and is currently an
executive board member of ACSR (Asian College of Schizophrenia Research),
as well as a member of TAPER (Tapering AntiPsychotics and Evaluating Recovery)
International Research Consortium.</p>
