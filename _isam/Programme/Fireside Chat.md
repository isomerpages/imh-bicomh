<p>Syazan co-founded “Project Get Flamed!” in 2020 with a simple goal in
mind: to build a positive and inclusive gaming community. The initiative
began as a finalist project under the Ministry of Education’s “What’s Your
Take – Youth Edition” on mental health and cyber wellness. As a core team
member, Syazan played a pivotal role in conceptualising the project, leading
the team in pitching and executing its ideals, which culminated in seed
funding and the opportunity to present the project prototypes to the Minister
of State for Education Ms Sun Xueling in 2021.</p>
<p>Seeking to expand the project outreach and engage more youths as game
changers, Syazan rallied youths from various polytechnics and ITEs to join
the team, and fully realise the potential of the prototypes. His leadership
led to successful funding under the “Our SG Fund for Digital Readiness”
from the Infocomm Media Development Authority, enabling the productions
of educational tools for community engagement.</p>
<p>In 2022, Syazan and his team kick-started a series of workshops and programmes
for schools and the wider community, engaging over 1,400 youths to date.
He looks forward to further expanding his team, partnership, and engagement
efforts to build a united front against toxic gaming culture.</p>
<p>A strong advocate for community empowerment, Syazan is currently a Year
3 Law undergraduate at Singapore Management University.</p>
